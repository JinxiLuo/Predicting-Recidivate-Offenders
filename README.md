# Predicting-Recidvate-Offenders
Themes: SAS, Predicting recvidisum, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network and Ensemble Models

**Project Summary**
This project provides an example of the work layout that I use for my reports, which is avalible for viewing in the two pdfs attached (Part 1 and 2 of Predicting Recidvate Offenders).

The goal for the project was to predict general offender recvidisum using the COMPAS data set for an introductory course in predictive methods. I first apply data cleaning, feature engienerning and selection techinques to try and extract potential usufel features from the dataset. Then a range of Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network and ensemble models are built and evaluated based on model praremters, feature importance and Balanced Classification Rate with training and validation data.
